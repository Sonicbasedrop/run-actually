## User Experience Design
### **The Strategy Plane**

This website was created for for the sole purpose of compleating my MS3 for the "Code Institue's" full stack software developer program. At the same time I am a avid runnner so I thought it would be cool to create a runners event site that I my self would use to find, create and particapate in the events. The aim is to provide users with a website that allows them to quickly find and sing up for, or create Runners Events that can be shared with other runner enthusiasts. All historical events should be recorded, although they do not have to be displayed as this data will not be needed until phase two enhancements of the website.
#### Site Goals
* To increase the number of participants in runners events by providing a simple, easy to use website that
contains all the details of upcoming events.
* Charities play a vital role in our lives and communities and Charities rely on fundraising to keep doing their work. Taking on a challenge is the perfect opportunity to start fundraising. This site give organizations and/or indivduals the opportunity to create charity runns so support great causes.
* Maintaining good health doesn't happen by accident. It requires work, smart lifestyle choices and Physical exercise. Exercise is important for people with mental illness â€“ it not only boosts our mood, concentration and alertness, but improves our cardiovascular and overall physical health. This site is all about promoting a healther way of life.

#### User stories

intended for upon entering.

 suited to me.
* As a user, I want a way to contact the site owner so that I can have any questions I may have in 
regards to the website answered.
* As a user, I want to be able to return to the main site without having to use the browser buttons so 
that I can easily return to the website if I navigate to a page that doesn't exist.

#### Database Design
MongoDB Object format examples:

**Collection: categories**<br>
{<br>
_id: unique-value,<br>
category_name: "Mud Runs"<br>
}

**Collection: events**<br>
{<br>
_id: unique-value,<br>
category_name: "5k Runs"<br>
date: "30 December, 2021"<br>
event_description: "Just a nice 5k run for the k-9's"<br>
event_name :"Muddle in puddle"<br>
is_urgent: "on"<br>
location: "Helsingborg, Sweden"<br>
created_by: "Admin<br>
}

**Collection: users**<br>
{<br>
_id: unique-value,<br>
name: "ivanmurraineulysses"<br>
username: "admin"<br>
eamil: "murraine8@gmail.com"<br>
password:*****************<br>
}
#### Security

Database connection details are set up in an [env.py](https://pypi.org/project/env.py/) for development, for 
security reasons this is not uploaded to GitHub so that database and connection details are not visible to 
users. In production these are stored in Heroku. 

### **The Surface Plane**
### Design

#### Planned Colour Scheme
The main background colours are a grey-blue color #78909c ![](readme_images/blue-grey.png) all buttons and h3 headings  are green #136259 ![](readme_images/green.png)
 
The main website text is black #000 ![](readme_images/black.png)
#### Typography
The title page font used for the webpage is 'Permanent Marker' and the plain text for the rest of the site is the font 'Montserrat'. 

#### Imagery
The background image used on all pages is taken with permission from a [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) contributar by the name of Alessio Soggetti see his fine work [Here](https://unsplash.com/@asoggetti)  

The website logo was created using online software from the website [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

## Difference in design
* Some of the design was changed during the development process. 
Some features in the profile page have postponed to the next itteration of the webiste, e.g. user ability to update profile page. 

* The 404 page was changed to another design from the  original design.

* The 400 Error page was not included in the original design but was implemented with the same page layout as the 404 page to account for any bad request errors.

* The 500 Error page was not included in the original design but was implemented with the same page layout as the 404 page to account for any internal server errors.

* Additional verification was added to the delete event button for the user to confirm they want to delete the event. This was added so the user doesn't accidentally delete an event and was implemented using a modal with the option to cancel or delete.

* Additional verification was added to the delete category button for the site owner to confirm they want to delete a category. This was added so the user doesn't accidentally delete an event and was implemented using a modal with the option to cancel or delete.

* The About page was changed to another design for a better user experience.
