## **1. User Stories Testing**  
### **Unregistered User Goals**   
As a new/ unregistered user, I want to:
1. Be able to search for an event easily
   * As a user, I want the main purpose of the site to be clear so that I immediately know what the site is intended for upon entering.   
   * As a user, I want to easily navigate the site so that I can find content quickly with ease.<br>
   ![Clear information on landing page](readme_images/testing_images/user_stories_images/index_page.png)<br>
   * As a user, I want the website to be responsive so that I can clearly view the webpages from my mobile, tablet or desktop.<br>
